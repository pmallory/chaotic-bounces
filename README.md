Chaotic Bounces
===============

This project exists so thet I can explore SciPy and NumPy. The objective is to model a simple chaotic system.

The system:
    Three circles of some radius are placed on the vertices of an equilateral triangle of some size centered on the origin. A particle with an initial position on the origin moving in a random direction will reflect off the circles zero or more times before it escapes. How many bounces it makes depends on its initial direction.
